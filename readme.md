# 05 - Superhero Bake Sale - revisited
For this assignment I want you to use the same premise as I described in the begining of the year, a Super Hero Bake Sale

This time, however, I am going to give you clearer goals along the way.

The ultimate goal is to build a game similar to the classic Apple Basic game, Lemonade Stand: https://classicreload.com/lemonade-stand.html .
But this game will emphasize the rediculous Super Heros who will attempt to compete with one another to sell the most baked good. The complete game spec is still fluid, but you must start developing the game following an MVC development process as your fictional creative team debates whether or not the game is fun enough to continue the development effort.

## Part 1:
You have been given a handful of custom types, a test, and some starter code:
* Main -- Launches the game ***DO NOT CHANGE THIS FOR PART 1***
* Cakes -- the thing your Heros will attempt to sell
* Customers -- the ones who will buy the Cakes
* Heros -- the ones who will bake the Cakes
* The Sale -- the place where the magic happens

Notice that the current code won't compile and has 5 errors! You must fix the errors right away! Notice also that the code is devoid of comments. Each class and method you touch, you must add [JAVADOC](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/java_documentation.htm) compatable comments.


### Your goals:
* FIX THE ERRORS!
* Comment the code such that clear JavaDoc can be generated from your code.
* Pass the test

Doing the above 3 things will get you a B+ minimum grade.
* Use the _Console command ___javac *.java; java AHeroSale___ to compile and run the static class __AHeroSale.java__ and run a __Sale__ that shows off your custom __Hero__ type.
  
Doing this last step while reusing your other types and not breaking the test will earn A and A- grades.

Examples of things a Hero might do include: Getting paid when someone buys their cake, Cake baking skills growing when they bake more cakes, showing pictures of themselves in ASCII art... It is up to you.
